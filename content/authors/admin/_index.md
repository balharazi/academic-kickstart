My name is Bshaer Alharazi. In Arabic, it means good news. I got this name because I was born in 1991 when Iraq and Kuwait were fighting. The same day that I was born, my uncle, who was sent to help there, was found alive and sent back home. Upon delivery, I was diagnosed with cerebral palsy but a cause was not identified. I didn’t show any signs of mental deficiencies.
Each visit to the doctor, my mental abilities are examined. From age 10 to 20 the questions remained the same, “What is your name? 5 x 4? Who is that?” pointing to my dad. Of course, I knew my name and my dad, but could not remember 5 x 4. I can remember my dad whispering 20…20. Not that I had mental issues, I just didn’t know the answer. Each visit I would try to explain that the only issues I had was walking, not with brain. Most were too confused of my lack of symptoms that aligned with cerebral palsy. The doctors claimed that anyone born with the disorder had speech problems and needed full time care. They were walked in circles, confused. How could I have the diagnosis but not the symptoms?!

 I spend a lot of time traveling the world, visiting several countries. Much of the time to have several surgeries and now for an education. Thankfully my intellect is intact. I always believed I had a well-functioning brain, so I focused on that. I obtained my bachelor’s degree with a 3.88 GPA. I am thankful to now have the change to obtain a Master in Multimedia Journalism at ATU. Here in the U.S., I can continue to push myself to accomplish my goals. In my free time, I enjoy reading and writing in Arabic. For now, I will continue to work on my dreams and share them with you when they come true!
