My name is Bshaer Alharazi. In Arabic, it means good news! I got this name because I was born in 1991. In the same day when I was born, my uncle, who was sent for a military mission, was found alive and sent back home. Upon delivery, I was diagnosed with cerebral palsy but the cause was not identified, and I didn’t show any signs of mental deficiencies.
Each visit to the doctor, my mental abilities are examined. from age 10 to 20 the questions remained the same, “What is your name? 5 x 4? Who is that?” pointing to my dad. Of course, I knew my name and my dad, but could not remember 5 x 4. I can remember my dad whispering 20…20. Not that I had mental issues, I just didn’t know the answer. In each visit I tried to explain that the only issue I have had is difficulty in walking , and had to do nothing with the brain. Most doctors were too confused of my lack of symptoms that aligned with cerebral palsy. The doctors claimed that anyone born with the disorder had speech problems and needed full time care. They were walked in circles, confused. How could I have the diagnosis but not the symptoms?!

All of them agree that fixing me is a MIRACLE and, it is really great news that I was an A student and I reached my dream and won the competition to be an instructor at Taif University
